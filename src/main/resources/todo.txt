Exchange Rate Challenge

Task

You should create an API that fetches exchange-rates from one or more publicly available APIs and uses them for conversion calculations.

1. Data source
a. Fetch data from this publicly available API, https://exchangerate.host
b. Any additional data source you may want to add (optional)

2. API operations
a. Get exchange rate from Currency A to Currency B
b. Get all exchange rates from Currency A
c. Get value conversion from Currency A to Currency B
d. Get value conversion from Currency A to a list of supplied currencies

3. Documentation
a. Use Swagger to provide documentation and a testing interface for the API,
like in this example: https://petstore.swagger.io/

Extra Credits

1. Introduce a mechanism to do as little calls as possible to the external provider, while
still providing meaningful/valid data. Assume that the clients don’t require real-time
data and that they are fine to receive data with up to 1 min of delay.
2. Add unit tests to cover your code.

Delivery

● You should use Java and the Spring framework.
● Host the project in a repository in your favourite Git provider: GitHub, GitLab or
Bitbucket - and commit frequently.
● The project should have a README that explains how to run it.
